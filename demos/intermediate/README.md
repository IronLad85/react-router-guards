# react-router-guards | Intermediate Demo

The intermediate demo uses the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to showcase how to use route guards for fetching data from an API.

## Installation

To install the project locally on your machine, do the following:

1. In the root directory, install the correct version of node using `nvm`:

   ```shell
   $ nvm install
   ```

2. In the root directory, install the dependencies for all directories:

   ```shell
   $ npm i && npm run bootstrap
   ```

## Getting started

To work actively on both the demo and `react-router-guards` package, you'll need both watch processes actively running. This can be done as follows:

1. In the root directory, ensure you're using the correct node version using `nvm`

   ```shell
   $ nvm use
   ```

2. In the root directory, run the start command:

   ```shell
   $ npm start
   ```

You should now be able to visit [localhost](http://localhost:3001) in your browser and begin development!
