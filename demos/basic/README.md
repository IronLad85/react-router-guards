# react-router-guards | Basic Demo

The basic demo showcases some basic functionality of route guard API with an auth example.

## Installation

To install the project locally on your machine, do the following:

1. In the root directory of the repository, install the package dependencies:

   ```shell
   $ npm i
   ```

2. In this directory (`/demos/basic`), install the package dependencies:

   ```shell
   $ npm i
   ```

3. Finallly, in the same directory, link the package to the demo using the script:

   ```shell
   $ npm run link:fresh
   ```

   This will allow you to make code changes to the package and have them update live for usage in the demo.

## Getting started

When actively working on both the demo and `react-router-guards` package, you'll need both watch processes actively running. This can be done as follows:

1. In a terminal window, run the following command in the root directory to start watching the package for changes:

   ```shell
   $ npm start
   ```

2. In a different terminal window or tab, run the following command in this directory (`/demos/basic`) to re-link the packages:

   ```shell
   $ npm run link
   ```

3. Finally, in the same window, run the following command to run the demo's development server:

   ```shell
   $ npm start
   ```

You should now be able to visit [localhost](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and begin development!

_**Note:** if at any time you would like to cancel the running server instances, press `CTRL + C` in the respective terminal window._
